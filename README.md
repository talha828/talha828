# 👨‍💻 I Build Thoughtful Tools with Flutter, AI, and Purpose

I’m a developer focused on building meaningful software — tools that work offline, respect privacy, and solve real-life problems. From AI chatbots trained on national law, to fitness apps that see your motion, to zero-trace quiz solvers — I like building things that feel useful from day one.

Whether it's cross-platform mobile apps, serverless APIs, or embedded AI, my goal is always the same: make something that just works, and works well.
